<p>It takes the average human fourteen minutes to fall asleep.</p>

<p>A good night's sleep consists of 5-6 complete sleep cycles</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that you should be falling asleep at these times.

sleepyti.me works by counting backwards in sleep cycles. Sleep cycles typically last 90 minutes.

Waking up in the middle of a sleep cycle leaves you feeling tired and groggy, but waking up in between cycles lets you wake up feeling refreshed and alert!</p>
